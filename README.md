# Heart-prediction-model
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on various health-related features using machine learning. The model is built with the XGBoost Classifier, a powerful and efficient gradient boosting algorithm, which has been trained on a dataset containing key factors that contribute to heart disease.
